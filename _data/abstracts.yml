"1902.06135": "We prove that the class of chordal graphs is easily testable in the following
sense. There exists a constant $c&gt;0$ such that, if adding/removing at most
$\\epsilon n^2$ edges to a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices does not make it chordal,
then a set of $(1/\\epsilon)^c$ vertices of $G$ chosen uniformly at random
induces a graph that is not chordal with probability at least $1/2$. This
answers a question of Gishboliner and Shapira."
"1703.02250": "We demonstrate that for every positive integer $\\Delta$, every
$K_4$-minor-free graph with maximum degree $\\Delta$ admits an equitable coloring
with k colors wherek $\\ge$ ($\\Delta$+3)/2. This bound is tight and confirms a
conjecture by Zhang and Whu. We do not use the discharging method but rather
exploit decomposition trees of $K_4$-minor-free graphs."
"1911.08452": "Motivated by a Gan-Loh-Sudakov-type problem, we introduce the regular Turán
numbers, a natural variation on the classical Turán numbers for which the
host graph is required to be regular. Among other results, we prove a striking
supersaturation version of Mantel's theorem in the case of a regular host graph
of odd order. We also characterise the graphs for which the regular Turán
numbers behave classically or otherwise."
"1304.5910": "Assuming the Generalised Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), we show that for all k,
there exist polynomials with coefficients in MA having no arithmetic
circuits of size $O(n^k)$ over the complex field (allowing any complex constant).
We also build a family of polynomials that can be evaluated in AM having no
arithmetic circuits of size $O(n^k)$. Then we investigate the link between
fixed-polynomial size circuit bounds in the Boolean and arithmetic settings. In
characteristic zero, it is proved that $NP \\not\\subset size(n^k)$, or $MA
\\subset size(n^k)$, or NP=MA imply lower bounds on the circuit size of uniform
polynomials in n variables from the class VNP over the complex field, assuming
GRH. In positive characteristic p, uniform polynomials in VNP have circuits of
fixed-polynomial size if and only if both VP=VNP over $F_p$ and Mod_pP has
circuits of fixed-polynomial size."
"1701.03366": "It was conjectured by Jaeger, Linial, Payan, and Tarsi in 1992 that for any
prime number $p$, there is a constant $c$ such that for any $n$, the union
(with repetition) of the vectors of any family of $c$ linear bases of
$\\mathbb{Z}_p^n$ forms an additive basis of $\\mathbb{Z}_p^n$ (i.e. any element
of $\\mathbb{Z}_p^n$ can be expressed as the sum of a subset of these vectors).
In this note, we prove this conjecture when each vector contains at most two
non-zero entries. As an application, we prove several results on flows in
highly edge-connected graphs, extending known results. For instance, assume
that $p\\ge 3$ is a prime number and $\\vec{G}$ is a directed, highly
edge-connected graph in which each arc is given a list of two distinct values
in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. Then $\\vec{G}$ has a $\\mathbb{Z}_p$-flow in which each arc
is assigned a value of its own list."
"1609.08645": "Is there some absolute $\\varepsilon &gt; 0$ such that for any claw-free graph
$G$, the chromatic number of the square of $G$ satisfies $\\chi(G^2) \\le
(2-\\varepsilon) \\omega(G)^2$, where $\\omega(G)$ is the clique number of $G$?
Erdős and Nešetřil asked this question for the specific case of $G$
the line graph of a simple graph and this was answered in the affirmative by
Molloy and Reed. We show that the answer to the more general question is also
yes, and moreover that it essentially reduces to the original question of
Erdős and Nešetřil."
"1811.02236": "We apply ideas from the theory of limits of dense combinatorial structures to
study order types, which are combinatorial encodings of finite point sets.
Using flag algebras we obtain new numerical results on the Erdős problem of
finding the minimal density of 5-or 6-tuples in convex position in an arbitrary
point set, and also an inequality expressing the difficulty of sampling order
types uniformly. Next we establish results on the analytic representation of
limits of order types by planar measures. Our main result is a rigidity
theorem: we show that if sampling two measures induce the same probability
distribution on order types, then these measures are projectively equivalent
provided the support of at least one of them has non-empty interior. We also
show that some condition on the Hausdorff dimension of the support is necessary
to obtain projective rigidity and we construct limits of order types that
cannot be represented by a planar measure. Returning to combinatorial geometry
we relate the regularity of this analytic representation to the aforementioned
problem of Erdős on the density of k-tuples in convex position, for large
k."
"812.01534": "We prove two distinct and natural refinements of a recent breakthrough result
of Molloy (and a follow-up work of Bernshteyn) on the (list) chromatic number
of triangle-free graphs. In both our results, we permit the amount of colour
made available to vertices of lower degree to be accordingly lower. One result
concerns list colouring and correspondence colouring, while the other concerns
fractional colouring. Our proof of the second illustrates the use of the
hard-core model to prove a Johansson-type result, which may be of independent
interest."
"1812.11152": "Given $\\varepsilon&gt;0$, there exists $f_0$ such that, if $f_0 \\le f \\le
\\Delta^2+1$, then for any graph $G$ on $n$ vertices of maximum degree $\\Delta$
in which the neighbourhood of every vertex in $G$ spans at most $\\Delta^2/f$
edges, (i) an independent set of $G$ drawn uniformly at random has at least
$(1/2-\\varepsilon)(n/\\Delta)\\log f$ vertices in expectation, and (ii) the
fractional chromatic number of $G$ is at most $(2+\\varepsilon)\\Delta/\\log f$.
These bounds cannot in general be improved by more than a factor $2$
asymptotically. One may view these as stronger versions of results of Ajtai,
Komlós and Szemerédi (1981) and Shearer (1983). The proofs use a tight
analysis of the hard-core model."
"1905.06031": "We investigate the effect of a fixed forbidden clique minor upon the strong

$\\frac32(k-2)\\Delta$. We present a construction certifying that if true the
conjecture is asymptotically sharp as $\\Delta\\to\\infty$. In support of the
conjecture, we show it in the case $k=4$ and prove the statement for strong

  By contrast, we make a basic observation that for $K_k$-minor-free simple
graphs, the problem of strong edge-colouring is \"between\" Hadwiger's Conjecture

"2007.07874": "We develop an improved bound for the chromatic number of graphs of maximum
degree $\\Delta$ under the assumption that the number of edges spanning any
neighbourhood is at most $(1-\\sigma)\\binom{\\Delta}{2}$ for some fixed

this bound is best possible as $\\sigma\\to0$. As two consequences, we advance
the state of the art in two longstanding and well-studied graph colouring
conjectures, the Erdős-Nešetřil conjecture and Reed's conjecture.
We prove that the strong chromatic index is at most $1.772\\Delta^2$ for any
graph $G$ with sufficiently large maximum degree $\\Delta$. We prove that the
chromatic number is at most $\\lceil 0.881(\\Delta+1)+0.119\\omega\\rceil$ for any

$\\Delta$. Additionally, we show how our methods can be adapted under the
additional assumption that the codegree is at most $(1-\\sigma)\\Delta$, and
establish what may be considered first progress towards a conjecture of Vu."
"1808.02512": "We prove that any triangle-free graph on $n$ vertices with minimum degree at
least $d$ contains a bipartite induced subgraph of minimum degree at least
$d^2/(2n)$. This is sharp up to a logarithmic factor in $n$. Relatedly, we show
that the fractional chromatic number of any such triangle-free graph is at most
the minimum of $n/d$ and $(2+o(1))\\sqrt{n/\\log n}$ as $n\\to\\infty$. This is
sharp up to constant factors. Similarly, we show that the list chromatic number
of any such triangle-free graph is at most $O(\\min\\{\\sqrt{n},(n\\log n)/d\\})$ as
$n\\to\\infty$.
<br>Relatedly, we also make two conjectures. First, any triangle-free graph on

graph on $n$ vertices has list chromatic number at most $O(\\sqrt{n/\\log n})$ as

"1703.06047": "For an integer $q\\ge 2$ and an even integer $d$, consider the graph obtained
from a large complete $q$-ary tree by connecting with an edge any two vertices
at distance exactly $d$ in the tree. This graph has clique number $q+1$, and
the purpose of this short note is to prove that its chromatic number is
$\\Theta\\big(\\tfrac{d \\log q}{\\log d}\\big)$. It was not known that the chromatic
number of this graph grows with $d$. As a simple corollary of our result, we
give a negative answer to a problem of van den Heuvel and Naserasr, asking
whether there is a constant $C$ such that for any odd integer $d$, any planar
graph can be colored with at most $C$ colors such that any pair of vertices at
distance exactly $d$ have distinct colors. Finally, we study interval coloring
of trees (where vertices at distance at least $d$ and at most $cd$, for some
real $c&gt;1$, must be assigned distinct colors), giving a sharp upper bound in
the case of bounded degree trees."
"1912.13328": "Motivated by a recent conjecture of the first author, we prove that every
properly coloured triangle-free graph of chromatic number $χ$ contains a
rainbow independent set of size $\\lceil\\frac12χ\\rceil$. This is sharp up to
a factor $2$. This result and its short proof have implications for the related
notion of chromatic discrepancy.
  Drawing inspiration from both structural and extremal graph theory, we
conjecture that every triangle-free graph of chromatic number $χ$ contains
an induced cycle of length $Ω(χ\\logχ)$ as $χ\\to\\infty$. Even if
one only demands an induced path of length $Ω(χ\\logχ)$, the
conclusion would be sharp up to a constant multiple. We prove it for regular
girth $5$ graphs and for girth $21$ graphs.
  As a common strengthening of the induced paths form of this conjecture and of
Johansson&#39;s theorem (1996), we posit the existence of some $c &gt;0$ such that for
every forest $H$ on $D$ vertices, every triangle-free and induced $H$-free
graph has chromatic number at most $c D/\\log D$. We prove this assertion with
\"triangle-free\" replaced by \"regular girth $5$\"."
